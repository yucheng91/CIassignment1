# The Walters

## Introduction
A website set up for a exisitng indie rock-band as part of the first assignment for Code Institute that covers HTML & CSS to showcase the understanding of the lesson throughout the course duration.
For this project, The Walters is a indie rock-band who will be performing in Singapore at the hard-rock cafe outlet (Orchard & Sentosa respectively) at the last weekend in the month of July to October 2019.  
The main objective of the website is to showcase their current discography as well as providing a platform for the visitors to RSVP to their events or reach out to their social media profile.

## UX
As the band is relatively young (establish in 2014) with limited discography. I have planned the website to be a single-page scrolling layout hence the user will be able to view all information within a single page.
Based on the tone of their musie (indie/alternative rock), I have selected a color scheme that reflects more on retro/nostalgia theme.

## Technologies
1.HTML  
2.CSS  
3.Bootstrap (v4.3.1)  
4.Font Awesome (v4.7)  
5.Google Fonts  
6.Jquery

## Features
The interactive features are as of following:  
- Social Media buttons under main group name (Facebook/Twitter/Youtube)
- The RSVP Button for visitors to RSVP to the event
- Spotify embedded player for vistors to have sneak peek of the song on site itself
- Youtube player for viewing of their music video
